Development proccess:

- Firstly, I started to create the UILayer and the swipe animation, using the technique `outside-in` so that I could have a quick feedback 
about my UILayer and could worry about the domain and data layer after that. 

- Socondly I chose to refector the code by using MVVM and started to create my Domain and the Data layer.

- After that, I focused on the conclusion of the animation and in the navigation whitin the app. 

- At the end, I chose to use a Composition Root to control the creation of the class.
